        "###1. What is a random variable in probability theory?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> A random variable is a function that assigns numerical values to the outcomes of a random experiment. It quantifies outcomes in a sample space and can be either discrete (like number of heads) or continuous (like time or temperature).\n",
        "\n",
        "###2. What are the types of random variables?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> There are two types:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Discrete random variable: Takes countable values (e.g., number of students).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Continuous random variable: Takes infinite values within a range (e.g., height, weight).\n",
        "\n",
        "###3. What is the difference between discrete and continuous distributions?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Discrete distributions represent probabilities at specific values while Continuous distributions describe the probability of outcomes over an interval and are represented by a probability density function.\n",
        "\n",
        "###4. What are probability distribution functions (PDF)?\n",
        "-> A PDF describes how the probabilities of a continuous random variable are distributed. It gives the likelihood that the variable falls within a particular range. The area under the PDF curve between two points gives the probability of falling within that range.\n",
        "\n",
        "###5. How do cumulative distribution functions (CDF) differ from PDFs?\n",
        "\n",
        "PDF shows probability density at a point while CDF shows the cumulative probability up to a certain point, defined as $𝐹 ( 𝑥 ) = 𝑃 ( 𝑋 ≤ 𝑥 )$\n",
        "\n",
        "###6. What is a discrete uniform distribution?\n",
        "-> It’s a distribution where all possible outcomes are equally likely. For example, in rolling a fair die, each outcome (1-6) has a probability of 1/6.\n",
        "\n",
        "###7. What are the key properties of a Bernoulli distribution?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Only two outcomes: success (1) and failure (0)\n",
        "\n",
        "- Probability of success = p, failure = 1−p\n",
        "\n",
        "- Mean = p, Variance = p(1−p)\n",
        "It models a single trial like flipping a coin.\n",
        "\n",
        "###8. What is the binomial distribution, and how is it used in probability?\n",
        "-> It gives the probability of having k successes in n independent Bernoulli trials. It's used in quality control, surveys, and experiments where outcomes are binary.\n",
        "\n",
        "###9. What is the Poisson distribution and where is it applied?\n",
        "-> Models the number of events in a fixed interval of time or space, assuming they occur independently at a constant average rate. Used in scenarios like call arrivals, decay rates, or web traffic.\n",
        "\n",
        "###10. What is a continuous uniform distribution?\n",
        "A distribution where all outcomes in a continuous range [a, b] are equally likely. The PDF is constant:\n",
        "\n",
        "$f(x)=1/(b-a)$ for $a \\leq x$ $\\leq $b\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "###11. What are the characteristics of a normal distribution?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Bell-shaped and symmetric\n",
        "\n",
        "- Mean = Median = Mode\n",
        "\n",
        "- Defined by mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ)\n",
        "\n",
        "- 68-95-99.7 rule applies for standard deviations from the mean\n",
        "\n",
        "###12. What is the standard normal distribution, and why is it important?\n",
        "-> It is a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's used for standardization and calculating Z-scores to compare different datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "###13. What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), and why is it critical in statistics?\n",
        "-> CLT states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size becomes large, regardless of the population's distribution. This is essential for making inferences about population parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "###14. How does the Central Limit Theorem relate to the normal distribution?\n",
        "-> It explains why the sampling distribution of the sample mean becomes approximately normal for large samples, enabling the use of normal-based methods in hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.\n",
        "\n",
        "###15. What is the application of Z statistics in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "-> Z statistics are used to test hypotheses about population means when the population standard deviation is known. It helps assess whether a sample mean significantly differs from a population mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "###16. How do you calculate a Z-score, and what does it represent?\n",
        "\n",
        "Z- score is calculated as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$Z=(X−𝜇)/𝜎$\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "It represents how many standard deviations a data point (X) is from the population mean (μ).\n",
        "\n",
        "###17. What are point estimates and interval estimates in statistics?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Point estimate: A single value estimate of a parameter (e.g., sample mean).\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Interval estimate: A range (confidence interval) within which the parameter lies with a specified probability.\n",
        "\n",
        "###18. What is the significance of confidence intervals in statistical analysis?\n",
        "-> They provide a range of values likely to contain the population parameter. A 95% confidence interval means that if we repeat the process 100 times, the true parameter would lie within the interval 95 times.\n",
        "\n",
        "###19. What is the relationship between a Z-score and a confidence interval?\n",
        "-> The Z-score sets the width of the confidence interval by determining how much uncertainty is allowed. Higher confidence means a larger Z-score and wider interval, ensuring a higher chance of capturing the true parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Z-scores determine the margin of error used in confidence intervals. For example, for a 95% confidence interval, Z = 1.96 is used in the formula.\n",
        "\n",
        "###20. How are Z-scores used to compare different distributions?\n",
        "-> They standardize values from different distributions, enabling direct comparison by removing units and expressing values in terms of standard deviations.\n",
